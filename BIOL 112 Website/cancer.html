            Maintaining long telomere length is crucial for cellular activity, especially for cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on the length of their cell life. In somatic cells, telomere lengths are usually not regulated by the telomere maintenance mechanism which causes its gradual degradation (Robert & Roger, 2015). On the other hand, cancer cells use this mechanism in order to lengthen their telomeres for greater replication. The TMM is typically divided into two mechanisms: telomerase-reverse transcriptase and alternative lengthening of telomeres each of which gives unique characteristics to different types of tumors.<br>
            
        </p>

        <h2>The ALT Pathway</h2>
            <p>
                The alternative lengthening of telomeres is a rare type of TMM that is only used in approximately 10-15% of all cancers (Robert & Roger, 2015). It is commonly found in tumors formed from mesenchymal cells or neuroendocrine cells and rarely in epithelial cells (Danny et al., 2021). The ALT pathway was initially discovered in cancer cells that were able to replicate telomeres regardless of telomerase activity. Scientists postulate that cancer cells may have chosen the ALT pathway in favor of TERT due to the strict maintenance of telomerase activity in mesenchymal cells (Robert & Roger, 2015). 
            From the evolutionary perspective, the emergence of telomerase may have been more favored than the ALT pathway for cancer cells, which could explain the reason as to why it is found in only a small percentage of tumors. As well, ALT may not only be used by cancer cells alone. Some researchers also believe that it may be a pathway that mammalian somatic cells use regularly in order to lengthen their telomeres, which in extreme cases may become cancer cells with uncontrolled growth (Aurore & Nicola, 2020). <br>
            </p>
        
        
        <h4>So, how does this ALT pathway work? Two proposed models explaining the mechanisms of the alt pathway include homologous recombination and the unequal T-SCEs...</h4>


        

        <h2>1) Homologous Recombination: </h2>
        
        <p>
            Researchers have discovered that increasing stress arising from replication may be a crucial component in telomeric extension. As well, increasing ALT characteristics were observed from telomeres with greater telomeric damages (Marta & Joanna & Nadia & Marco, 2020), hinting at a potential mechanism involved with telomere damage that allows for the alt to occur. This has led to the idea that homologous recombination of telomeric DNA may be a crucial component of this pathway. Reasons as to how homologous recombination occurs is still unknown in complete detail. Over the past few years, however, studies have been made to determine common patterns within this pathway. 
Homologous recombination (HR) is the exchange of genetic information. In the case of telomeres, it is the exchange of telomeric DNA. Interestingly, telomeres are able to form a loop called a t-loop that allows them to replicate their own DNA. (Anthony & Roger, 2010) Telomeres can also “invade” their own sister chromatid, using it as a template to replicate their own DNA. As well, HR can occur in either linear or circular strands of extrachromosomal DNA of telomeres.

        <p> Why does HR occur? During the replication process, the replication fork often stalls due to various stresses from the environment. This gives rise to a phenomenon called DSB or DNA strand break, which in turn invokes a DNA damage response (DDR). HR takes on the role of recuperating double strand breaks, as well as controlling and preserving the replication fork (Murfuni & Rass, 2016). The proteins involved in this repair are used in the ALT mechanism to lengthen telomeres through a process called the Break Induced Telomere Synthesis (BITS) (Robert & Roger, 2015). Scientists believe that cancer cells maintain a careful balance in their proliferation through regulating homologous recombination (Robert & Roger, 2015). If there was to be no recombination, the telomere would continually shorten and eventually, the cancer cell will die. However, allowing continuous recombinations to occur could lead to cell death from instability of the genes. </p>

        <h2>2) Unequal T-SCEs </h2>
        
        <p>
            Another model called the unequal telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE) hypothesizes that there is a relationship between the exchange of telomere sister chromatids and telomere lengthening (Anthony & Roger, 2010). This was supported by an experiment that revealed that damages within the DNA of telomeres could result in the lengthening of a daughter cell telomere and a shortening of another. The lengthened telomere will then have a prolonged cell life in contrast to the shorter telomere. The specificities of this model is yet sunknown in detail and requires further information to verify its connections with ALT.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Common characteristics of ALT:
        </h2>

        <p>
            A common feature of ALT cells is that they are usually characterized with very long or very short telomeres compared to normal somatic cells . Furthermore, researchers have found a pattern among telomere bases that may be unique to ALT positive cells. Specific telomere bases such as TCAGGG and TGAGGG may be a common characteristic of alt cells (Aurore & Nicola, 2020). Especially, the TCAGGG is known to attract receptors and complexes crucial to the ALT pathway. Further features are related to molecules involved in the process of homologous recombination and are crucial components of biomarkers.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Phenotypic characteristics and Biomarkers
        </h2>

        <p>
            Biomarking, according to cancer.gov, is a method of using biological molecules to determine the proper diagnosis required to treat cancer patients. Unfortunately, the ALT mechanism is difficult to identify due to its many unique characteristics (Danny et al., 2021). As a result, there is no single definition that defines it. Multiple research and experiments have narrowed down alt biomarkers to several distinct types including but is not limited to telomere length, T-SCE, ECTRs, TIFs, APBs, Telo-Fish and C-circle assay.

            <li><u><strong>Long telomeres:</strong></u>
                Telomere length is often used to distinguish ALT + cells and can go up to more than 50 kilobases long (Danny et al., 2021). This type of identification isn’t isn’t always a good indicator of ALT as TEL+ cells show similar characteristics.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><u><strong>Telomere sister chromatid exchange (tSCE):</strong></u>  T-SCEs are thought to be found in greater amounts in alt + cells than in cells using the TERT pathway. This method of identification, however, is restricted as it can only be done through culturing cells.</li>
                <br>
                <li><u><strong>Extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ECTRs):</strong></u> A high number of ECTR is often found in alt+ cells (Aurore & Nicola, 2020) and may be used to detect alt positivity.
                    C-circle assay (CCA) 
                    The CCA is a special type of ECTR that quantifies the process of ALT. Scientists believe that it is formed from the DDR of fixing replication forks. It is also the most accepted biomarker in clinical practices.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                <li><u><strong>Telomeric Induced Foci (TIFs):</strong></u> ALT+ cells usually contain high levels of telomeric DNA damage (Danny et al., 2021). TIFs are used to detect these damages, nonetheless, as telomeric dna damages cannot be solely caused from the alt pathway, it is considered as a weak indicator. </li>
                <br>
                <li><u><strong>APBs:</strong></u> Telomeric recombination is thought to occur at APBs, where the DDR occur (Thomas et al., 2020). Biomarkers related to these sites may be good indicators of ALT + cells. The downside to this biomarker is that APBs are also seen in TERT cells which means that it cannot be used to identify Alt cells alone  (Danny et al., 2021). This method of identification is often used in large groups.</li>
                <br>
                <li><u><strong>Telo-FISH </strong></u>
                    The telo-fish observes punctate nuclear foci, damages in telomeric DNA and DDR which can help identify alt + cells. The marker consists of determining whether the number of foci is greater than 1%. If yes, the tumor is thought to use the ALT pathway. This marker is one of the favored methods of identifying ALT positivity and researchers believe it is efficient enough to be used alone and without any supplementary biomarkers.

        <h2>ALT Therapies</h2>

        <p>Researchers are still experimenting ways to effectively target ALT positive cells. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical resection are the most prevalent methods of therapies for gliomas. However there isn’t a specific treatment that specifically treats ALT+ cells. Listed below are some potential treatments for ALT:</p>

        <div class="exp">
        <ol style = "padding: 20px;">
            <li><u><strong>ATR inhibitors:</strong></u> The ATR protein is involved in fixing damaged DNA during DNA damage repair (Robert & Roger, 2015). The RPA (replication protein a) is a protein involved in homologous recombination. Experiments revealed that ATR inhibitors target telomeres through the RPA and eliminate ALT cells. This may be a potential inhibitor of homologous recombination for cancer cells.</li><br>
            <li><u><strong>G4 ligands:</strong></u> G-quadruplex ligands are most prevalent in telomeres and could be used to decrease ALT activity by disrupting telomeres and resulting in cancer cell death(Thomas et al., 2020).</li><br>
            <li><u><strong>Oncolytic virotherapy (ATRX and DAXX):</strong></u> The ATRX and DAXX are genes that are often found mutated in alt+ cells (Danny et al., 2021). This leads to a decrease in the synthesis of ATRX and DAXX proteins which is correlated with increased DNA damage from fork stalling (Thomas et al., 2020). They have the role of providing protection for the cell from viruses. Scientists are hoping to create treatments based on these proteins by using an oncolytic virotherapy approach. Oncolytic virotherapy is a way of infecting cancer cells with an adenovirus that selectively invades alt cells. Through this method, the virus suppresses the activity of the ATRX protein which causes the alt cells to be unprotected from the virus. Eventually, the virus lyses the ALT+ cell. Researchers state that multiple versions of the virus will have to be made in preparation for resistance of cancer cells. It has been shown effective in eliminating alt cells in multiple experiments and is therefore a promising treatment for future treatments (Danny et al., 2021).</li><br>
            <li><u><strong>RAD52 inhibitor: </strong></u> RAD52 is a gene that encodes for the protein necessary for homologous recombination (Thomas et al., 2020). Inhibition of this gene could be used to prevent further elongation of the telomere.</li><br>
            <li><u><strong>Targeting C-circles:</strong></u> T-circles in ALT are used in HR to replicate DNA in circles and are present in both telomerase positive and alt positive cells. C-circles are a special form of t-circles, much more unique to ALT cells. Researchers have found that there are a higher number of C-circles in alt positive cells (Yuanliang et al., 2020). This may be used as an indicator of ALT allowing for treatment specific to alt cells. </li><br>
        </ol>
        </div>
    

        <h2>ALT and TERT</h2>
        <p>It is also thought that alt and tert positive cells may work in combination in one tumor (Thomas et al., 2020). In an experiment with mice, the ALT pathway was activated in response to a loss of telomerase in tumors. This could mean that either pathway could be triggered by the tumor, depending on the availability of telomerase and the environmental conditions. Scientists suggest an inhibitor that prevents both the activity of TERT and ALT in order to completely stop cancer cell proliferation.</p>

        <h2>Ever Shorter Telomeres</h2>
        <p>The ever shorter telomeres is a newly found pathway that cancer cells use to increase in number even when their telomeres constantly reduce in size. Specific details of this mechanism are yet unknown to the scientific community (Rebecca et al., 2017). </p>
