            <h2>What is TERT?</h2>
        <p class = "main_p">
                As many living organisms exist through time, their cells tend to become increasingly unstable, which leads to a very common concern known as aging. As seen through different studies, the significant aging of organisms and their cells is affected by telomeres. This structure maintains genomic integrity in cells and is very crucial for the enzymatic activity of telomerases. However, over time these structures tend to shorten, which inevitably causes cells to become more unstable through each successive mitosis process during cellular division. This incomplete replication may also be referred to as the “end-replication problem” (B. Heidenreich, et. al).
Several studies have shown that cancer cells have an immunity towards this type of telomere shortening and aging over time. This immortality is initiated through the activation of a human gene TERT, which encodes for the telomerase. The telomerase is a protein with reverse transcriptase activity that will interact with other proteins and functional RNA to then make an RNA enzyme complex. In human cells, this gene can also be referred to as the hTERT (M. Daniel, et. al). This revealed immortality that cancer cells have obtained, may be a crucial factor in formulating a type of alteration preventing cell aging from occurring in an organism’s body. The experimentation of different TERT activation methods and telomere length regulation has revealed that these structures may be essential to the immortality of cells other than cancerous ones.

                                    This diagram illustrates how germline and stem cells demonstrate increased hTERT expression and constant telomeres lengths over time. However, somatic cells undergo cellular division and through this graph, it is observed that hTERT expression and telomere length significantly decreases, leading to sooner cell death. The very few cells that are to obtain immortality through the “pre-crisis” stage, are shown to comprise cancerous cell types1.</p>

                                    It can be demonstrated here that the TERT contributes to a large portion <br> of the telomerase’s expression and activity over time, <br> whether those be related to telomere activity (“canonical functions”) or not (“non-canonical functions”)1.</p>

            <p> 
                The TERT consists of four major domains, an essential N-terminal, TERT RNA-binding domain (TRBD), reverse transcriptase domain (RT), and a C-terminal extension (the CTE), all combined to create a ring-like structure (M.V Dhodapkar, et. al). The TERT has been analyzed to be 42kb long and consisting of about 15 introns and 16 exons and lacks a TATA box usually found in other cells (M. Dratwa, et. al). TERT alternatively includes a promoter structure that has been found to be located on the 5p15.33 chromosome, containing around 260 base pair sequences (B. Heidenreich, et. al).  This promoter sequence contains many types of binding factors for other proteins that help control telomere lengthening. This regulation due to the TERT promoter may be a large contributor to cancer cell immunity to cellular senescence.

                                        It can be observed that the shortening of telomeres reactivates telomerase activity. The TERT’s now enhanced activity initiates a larger amount of cell production, increasing the amount of cancer and cell aging. This can add that by inhibiting the activity of the telomerase, it is possible for the aging of cells to be limited over time2.</p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively, the activity of the TERT can be regulated by hormones in the body, some of which may include cytokines and oncogenes. There also are many inhibitors present in the cell that may interact with the TERT gene. For instance, there is a protein called c-Myc that forms a complex mainly with another protein known as N-Myc (B. Heidenreich, et. al). This overall complex structure can inhibit the activity of the TERT’s promoter sequence, which reduces the levels of telomerase produced in the cell. Furthermore, there have been other recent studies revealing specific germline and somatic mutations in cancers within the TERT promoter that introduces new complex factors. These complexes can provide an opportunity into the causes for tumor specific TERT expressions that have been significantly increased over time.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TERT also interacts with the telomerase RNA component, an RNA sequence that functions as a template for synthesis of telomeres. This sequence is accompanied by many different proteins, some of which are referred to as Dyskerin, the non-histone chromosomal protein, nucleolar, glycine arginine rich 1 heat shock, ribonucleoproteins NOP10, GAR1, and NHP2 (B. Heidenreich, et. al). These proteins are crucial factors in maintaining the telomere’s homeostasis and the overall aging process of cells. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main catalytic component of the TERT has been found to be repressed in most somatic cells, which largely relates to the production of telomerase. If repressed, the production of telomerase enzymes can be temporarily inhibited, which is said to be a possible beneficial method for killing cancer cells. This method will in fact eliminate the cells that form due to the presence of telomerase; however, the only issue with this method is that if the cancer cells are indeed eliminated, there may also be other important germline cells that may be damaged at the same time. For example, some of these types of cells could include sperm, eggs, platelets, and other cells used for immunity from viruses (yourgenome, 2017). Even though the telomerase activity in most somatic cells is still somewhat very low, there still exists a risk of affecting the organism being treated through this process.

                    There is a type of chromosomal arrangement that affects gene copy numbers in the TERT is known as the TMM. The TMM can also be known as the telomere maintenance mechanism, to which is described to maintain telomere length (M. Dratwa, et. al).  These kinds of chromosomal arrangements may involve gene rearrangements such as duplications, insertions, and deletions, as well as intrachromosomal changes, epigenetic alterations, transcription factor binding, and alternative splicing of genes. When both the TERT and the ALT are absent in a cell, there is a mechanism called the NDTMM, also known as the non-defined telomere maintenance mechanism which is then activated.

                    TERT amplification can result from telomere dysfunction. This affliction promotes the fusion of chromosome ends, leading to an abnormal final chromosomal structure. There are different types of cancer to which this alteration of chromosome shape is present, such as esophageal, ovarian, squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, thyroid carcinoma, and lung carcinoma. TERT amplification has been found to be almost non-existent in somatic cells, but very high in cancer cells (M. Dratwa, et. al).  In fact, it has been found that tumors have the largest and highest activity of telomerase due to high rates of TERT amplification. This can imply that telomere altering could have a significant place in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, as well as strong placeholders in targeted substances used for therapeutic techniques.

                    Several strategies have been formed, such as telomerase inhibition, telomerase peptide vaccines, and suicide gene therapies. Telomerase inhibition includes compounds that interact with the 3’ end of the DNA to which stabilizes the secondary structures in protein formation. This will block the telomerase’s access to the DNA, therefore inhibiting the aging of the cells slightly. Some of these binding proteins could include BRACO-19, RHPS4, and THPyP4. Telomerase peptide vaccines can access the telomerase active site by basing its peptide sequence from the TERT active site. There is only one vaccine still in its trial period, known as GV1001 which can be used to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as melanoma, lung, and pancreatic cancers. There is another vaccine mentioned, GRNVAC1, that is used for trans-infecting dendritic cells. This is done through mRNA coding TERT proteins to which enter the organism’s body for further treatment. This vaccine is still in its clinical trial period and is said to be only used on patients so far with metastatic prostate cancer. Suicide gene therapy is mainly used to treat cancer so far, by targeting and lysing tumors and any unhealthy cells present in the targeted area. This relies heavily on TERT promoter controlling expressions of only bacterial proteins called nitro-reductase. This method has not been released to clinical trials yet, however, it could be an option in the future for cancer elimination methods (M. Dratwa, et. al).
