            <h2>What are Telomeres and how were they discovered?</h2>
        
            <p>
                Telomeres are most influential in eukaryotic (multi-celled organisms) processes as a biological indicator of the health and the lifespan of the cell. They are protective caps found at the end of chromosomes that protect genetic material from potential dangers such as  being recognized as damaged (danger signals), breaking down of nucleotides and unnecessary mixing with other chromosomes. (Lu et al., 2013)  The concept of telomeres was first unearthed in the 1930s by American scientists Herman Muller and Barbara Mccintlock. Essentially, Muller first used X Rays to manipulate chromosomes into different breakage and fusion mutations. (Shay, 2018) By conducting these tests, he noticed that the ends of the chromosomes were actually not affected by the procedure, thus deducing that they had a special property. (Shay, 2018)  Later, Nobel Prize Winner Mccintlock continued the studying of chromosome fusions and discovered that telomeres stopped fusions from happening by looking at stoppages of breakage and fusion cycles within eukaryotic cells. (Shay, 2018)<br>

            <h2>The biological makeup of Telomeres</h2>
        
            <p>
                As modern medicine progressed and more information about DNA and genetics was being unearthed, detailed biological descriptions were found about telomeres. Telomeres in mammalian cells are repetitive sequences of TTAGGG nucleobase sequences terminated by unpaired 3’ nucleotides. (Lu et al., 2013) Because of the abundance of guanine, telomeres can fold into G quadruplexes, helical structures with bases that can both accept and give hydrogen bonds as well as fold up to display its protective properties. (Zakian, 2012) The enzyme telomerase adds more of these guanine rich TTAGGG sequences to the end of the chromosome which maintains the length of the telomeres. (Zakian, 2012) The 3’ overhangs (unpaired nucleotides) at the end of these sequences also help regulate and maintain length. (Lu et al., 2013)

                                   This diagram shows that the repeating TTAGGG sequences in the chromosome are divided from the rest of the chromosomal DNA by subtelomeric DNA that participates in various telomeric functions. 2</p>

            <h2>Why are Telomeres important?</h2>
            <p>
                The length of the telomeres is its most important factor. Compare it to any everyday object with a cap such as a water bottle or pen. The longer the cap is, the better protected the contents are. The same can be applied to telomeres. However, telomeres degrade at a rate of around 26 base pairs per DNA replication. (Lu et al., 2013)  Because more replications happen as time progresses, the telomeric length acts as a biological clock. With this shortening, the genetic information is less protected and more susceptible to genomic damage and age-related diseases such as cancer. In fact, cancer cells show reduced telomere length compared to healthy cells. Is there some way we can slow down telomere degradation?
            </p>
            <h2>Lifestyle factors that affect Telomere degradation</h2>
            <p>
                Studies conducted and reviewed by A. Shammas in 2011 show that many lifestyle changes can affect the length of telomeres, increase the pace of aging and lead to an onset of various diseases. Unhealthy habits such as smoking are shown to accelerate telomere degradation as the toxic fumes cause oxidative stress and lead to an additional loss of base pairs. Blood tests also reveal that tobacco smokers have an increased rate of telomere reduction.
Dietary habits and obesity are also factors that can affect telomere shortening. Healthy portions of fiber, fat, and antioxidants are positively correlated with reduced rates of telomere shortening. Studies performed on rats showed that protein and fatty acid restricted diets can lead to longer telomeres in the kidney. Japanese reports also indicate an association between higher life expectancy and low protein high carbohydrate diets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, obesity and higher waist circumferences also cause oxidative stress which can lead to DNA damage. Studies comparing the telomere length of obese and lean women show that the telomeres are around 8.8 years shorter in obese woman (lean women would need another 8.8 years to reach the same length). Inversely, dietary restrictions and restrained food consumption in rats and other rodents are shown to lead to less oxidative stress and higher life expectancies.

                                    These two tables show the relative telomere length and quantity between high stress and low stress cells. Table one compares the average telomere length given by a t/s ratio while table two compares the amount of telomeric units per 10,000 cells. As shown, low stress cells have significantly higher telomeric length and units compared to high stress cells. 3</p>

            <p>
                Several socio-economic factors such as surrounding air pollution, profession and stress can also cause reduction in the size of telomeres. Oxidation tests from professionals working in areas of heavy air pollution such as coke-ovens and traffic stops a correlation between telomere length/ DNA damage and time duration iin these environments. Furthermore, stress causes the adrenal gland to secrete glucocorticoid hormones. These hormones are known to cause damage related to oxygen deficiencies which can lead to increased telomere shortening rates. To counteract this, it is recommended to exercise regularly as it accelerates waste removal and reduces oxidative stress. (Shammas, 2011)

                Telomeres prevents genomic damage in by serving as a shielding cap at the tips of chromosomes. They also serve as a biological clock that indicates the age and health of the cell because they get shorter as more DNA replications happen over time.
